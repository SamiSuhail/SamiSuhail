Hello, my name is Sami and I am an aspiring Software Developer.

Recent graduate at SoftUni, I am able to work with ASP.NET Core (MVC and Web API) paired with EF Core and MSSQL Server. 

After I finish my current ongoing Web Api project, I will be learning React Js in order to complete my stack.


I have always been a fan of maths and sciences as a kid (friends called me the Math God - but I haven't done any maths in over 2 years so that is in the past), and pairing that with my love of gaming, the programming choice was somewhat obvious, and boy was it a good one.
I learn the concepts extremely fast, and my debugging is pretty darn good, there hasn't really been a situation where I have not managed to find a solution.

Having previous experience as a Junior Tech Support Eng., I am used to challenges and quick-thinking, as well as teamwork, and autonomy.
