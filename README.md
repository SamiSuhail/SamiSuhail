Hey there, and welcome to my github repo. Who am I? Recent graduate at SoftUni, and a Junior Dev since November 2021.
What am I good at? ASP.NET Core MVC, Web API, EF Core... - ugh, boring.

What do I believe in? If my skills were defined by what technologies I work with I'd call myself a coder, not a dev, not an engineer. Our job is to solve problems, and not only solve them, but predict them as much as possible, and we need to know what the point of failure is, and do our best to make it bulky. 

A truly skilled developer knows that when they get a task, their first priority is to identify the problem, and I don't mean the code, I mean we need to know why the business needs that to be done, and if there is a smarter, better way to achieve that need, even if it does not involve code in what we are used to (.NET in my case) then we need to go and find out what tool works best for that. Technologies are amazing tools, which we can and should use to learn and progress, but we need to be bigger than that.

I cannot say my arsenal of tools is huge, but that is only a question of time, my true skills are great learning and ease in understanding some (at a glance) more complex concepts. This early in my career (about 5 months so far) I'm already working with MicroServices in a pretty complex product and have dipped my toes into DevOps (AKS and CI/CD). I wouldn't dare say those are skills I've mastered, and am well aware there is a whole world to learn, but it is only a matter of time.

Next, you need to love what you do, it's the most important aspect. If you love what you're doing and you're doing it with love, the problem-solving comes naturally, you want your software to progress in the best, most sustainable and yet efficient possible way, you can't know everything but if you enjoy it and have the curiosity, you will find a way to progress, and the right people will find you. 

Try to bring value, not to be a machine. 
If you feel like the progress of your company does not depend at all on your personal individual input, then you're either not in the right environment, or you don't love the work you do.
